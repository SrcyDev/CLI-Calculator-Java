# CLI-Calculator

This is CLI Calculator Repo and it can be used to calculate in a console based way.

## Notes:
1.The current python version `1.0` Does not support Float points and will return a error.
2.The `.jar` file can only be executed through console
  using `java - jar <tofilepath/name.jar>`. It does not work any other way.

## Whats with the Java and Python versions ?
Here, Both versions are available based on the use.
I will recommend the python version as it will recieve more updates for bugs.

## Any other languages in the near future ?

There will likely be a bash version for Linux.
Use the `.exe` for Windows in the python releases.

## Which version should I choose ?

Choose the version depending on your use case.
Python one will be more updated and easier to use 
than the Java one.
